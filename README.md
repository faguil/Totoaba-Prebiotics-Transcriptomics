# Totoaba_transcriptomics
Identification of differentially expressed genes in Totoaba juveniles exposed to different prebiotics

Public repository for bioinformatics analysis conducted in the evaluation of different prebiotics (i.e., chitosan, inulin, beta-glucan) on juveniles of Totoaba macdonaldi

This repository contains:

* Bash script to make a fake annotation file of the de novo reference transcriptome of Totoaba macdonaldi (filename = Totoaba.fake-annotation-transcriptome.sh)
* R script to conduct the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using DESeq2 (filename = Totoaba.DESeq2.R)
* R script to conduct the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using edgeR (filename = Totoaba.edgeR.R
* R script to conduct the gene ontology (GO) enrichment of DEGs using topGO (filename = topGO.R)
